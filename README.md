# 30 Days of JavaScript Loops

This repository is my personal **30-day challenge** to practice and improve JavaScript loops.  
Every day I solve one or two loop-related challenges, write the solution in JavaScript,  
and also create a **flowchart** to visualize the logic.

---

## Structure
Each day has its own folder:
- **day1/**
  - `challenge.md` → problem statement  
  - `solution.js` → JavaScript solution  
  - `flowchart.png` → flowchart image  
  - `README.md` → notes or explanation 

---

## Goals
- Practice JavaScript loops daily  
- Improve algorithmic thinking  
- Visualize problems with flowcharts  
- Build consistency (commit every day for 30 days)  

---

## Daily Progress
- [Day 1](./day1)
- [Day 2](./day2)
- [Day 3](./day3)
- ...
- [Day 30](./day30)

---

## Outcome
By the end of these 30 days I will have:
- 30+ loop challenges solved  
- 30 flowcharts  
- Stronger JavaScript foundations
